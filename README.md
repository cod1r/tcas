# Traffic Collision Avoidance System

This is a simulation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for the class, Real Time Systems at the University of Houston.
This isn't a good implementation of how the TCAS system works relative to the actual TCAS implementation that is currently used in some aircrafts but it does provide a good enough visual representation of what is happening and expresses the basic ideas of how aircrafts can avoid colliding with other aircrafts. - Jason Ho 15-4-2022 2:33 AM
